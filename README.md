## Data requirements

For the data processing pipeline to work, please store the raw intraday data in data/flash_crash_DJIA/ where each ticker is stored in a tar ball with the filename {ticker}.OQ-2010.tar (e.g. AAPL.OQ-2010.tar) or {ticker}.N-2010.tar (e.g. AXP.N-2010.tar).


## Results

To get the results and plots, please simply run the bash script everything.sh by running `./everything.sh` in the command line.
